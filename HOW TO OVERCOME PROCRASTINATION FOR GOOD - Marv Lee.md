HOW TO OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION FOR GOOD - Marv Lee

My method is 100% EFFECTIVE:

Hard truth:

Procrastination will straight up ruin your life if you let it.

How do you plan to get ahead if you always put things off to the last minute?

No chance.

You have to be prompt and consistent to achieve greatness.

Unless you want to live a mediocre life...

I used to be a chronic procrastinator.

100 self-help books couldn't save me.

In fact

They encouraged the problem.

It took years of self-awareness to figure out what I'm about to share with you...

There are three underlying causes of procrastination

1 - A weak willpower
2 - Poor emotional control
3 - Lack of motivation

Most people only try to solve the last one.

They watch tons of motivational videos but keep falling back to their habits.

Let's get to the roots...

WILLPOWER

This is the ability to command your body and mind to do as you say.

The mind loves distractions and entertainment.

The body loves sleep and idleness.

Never bend to their whims.

You must command them with all intention and seriousness.

When you want to study
Your brain shuts down.

When you want to meditate
Your mind becomes 10x more restless.

When you want to fast
The hunger becomes life-threatening.

Notice the pattern?

These are all illusions displayed by the body-mind to dissuade you.

They are unreal!

The important thing here

Is to be as stubborn as a mule.

Face any resistance that comes up with unwavering resolve.

Become an unmovable force!

Say to your mind;

For this set period of time

Not even God can stop me from doing this.

It takes extreme seriousness to master your willpower.

Never negotiate with your mind

And never compromise on your plans.

Do what needs to be done

When it needs to be done.

Practice the 5-count hack.

Countdown from 5 and jump into action immediately.

Build momentum with small efforts.

The longer you wait the harder it gets.

EMOTIONAL CONTROL

Your energy level depends on your emotional state.

Understand this:

You don't have to feel like to get things done.

Your mood is irrelevant.

Channel whatever emotion you are feeling at that moment productively.

For long-term consistency

You must learn to balance your emotions.

Never get so excited that you lose your composure.

Never get so depressed that you lose your willpower.

Observe your thoughts and emotions like a watchdog.

Notice how your moods fluctuate.

This does two things:

1. Reveal the underlying feeling that's fueling your procrastination.

2. Show you how to alter your moods by changing your thoughts.

Once you identify the underlying emotion

You can employ specific mental models or affirmations to counter it.

The common culprits are

Fear, paralysis, and lack of confidence...

You feel fear when the task at hand seems tedious and scary.

99% of the time it is a mental exaggeration.

Once you start

You'll often realize that it's not as daunting as your mind made it out to be.

Deconstruct the task down into easy hurdles.

Take it one step at a time.

Paralysis stems from overthinking and sensory overload.

The key is to release the mental tension by taking immediate action.

Stop the process as soon as you notice it.

Make fast decisions
Take a shower
Take a walk
Do some push-ups

But never succumb to the paralysis.

Procrastination compounds self-doubt.
Productivity compounds self-confidence.

You need to build a good reputation with yourself by stacking small wins.

As you act on your will

You will find it easier to brush off your mind's excuses

Until discipline becomes second nature.

LACK OF MOTIVATION

Watching motivational videos won't fix this problem.

Here's why it happens:

1. You are not emotionally invested.
2. The task is boring and uninspiring.
3. Your brain is understimulated or overstimulated.

If it's not compulsory

Leave it and find better use for your time.

Otherwise take control of your emotions using the aforementioned mental models.

Create incentives that inspiring you.

Understand this:

Boredom is a prerequisite.

Success is achieved by doing simple things repeatedly for a long period of time.

Embrace it.

The more comfortable you are with the mundane
The less you'll rely on cheap dopamine to distract yourself with.

Use the carrot and stick approach;

Reward yourself for completing tasks
Or delay certain gratifications until they are done.

For example
Don't pick up your phone in the morning until you go for a run.

To emphasize:

You don't need self-help books

You need self-awareness.

All the motivation you need is within.

All the mental blocks are within too.

Use your self-awareness to expose your excuses and alchemize your distractions.

I'm rooting for you ðŸ–¤
